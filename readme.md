Source for the images are listed in the file `source.txt` inside their respective folder.

Wallpaper search sites I recommend and where most of the images come from :

-   https://wallhaven.cc/
-   https://wall.alphacoders.com/ (or https://alphacoders.com/)
-   https://www.uhdpaper.com/

The day I use a 1440p/4K monitor i'll delete all 1080p images, sorry :(((
